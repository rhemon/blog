Hello there,

I have finally created my first blog. Its being hosted on github, and to run
it I am using Jekyll. It sure made blogging far more easier for people like me who like
coding at the same time don't want to have tough time managing content.

Now that I have started my blog, I do plan on frequently adding content and hopefully
improve over time.

I had been planning to create a blog for a long time and finally took the initiative after
receiving it as a task in Google Code-in, the contest that I am currently participating in. I plan on writing updates every time I complete a task. This is why I
have a category for GCI, all related posts will be categorized under it.

Thanks for coming here. Hope you will visit again.
