Hello there,

I have finally created my first blog. Its being hosted on github, and to run
it I am using Jekyll. It sure made blogging far more easier for people like me who like
coding at the same time don't want to have tough time managing content.

Now that I have started my blog, I do plan on frequently adding contents and bring more
improvement over time.

I had been planning to create a blog for a long time and finally took the initiative after
getting it as a task in Google Code-in, the contest that I am participating now. While taking part
in the contest, I plan on writing updates every time I do a task. That is exactly why I
have a category for GCI, all post related to that will be categorized under that.

Thanks for coming here. Hope you visit again.
