Hello there,

This is the article where I will writing about why I have decided to do the FOSSASIA
community's tasks for my Google Code-in participation, and what this participation means to me. However, before I start my talk on that I would like have a brief introduction of FOSSASIA.

FOSSASIA is an organization (situated in Asia, established in 2009) that has been supporting developers and makers of open source technologies. The organization has a community of developers who do open source projects, like web applications, android applications, and many more. However, FOSSASIA's community isn't only about developers making softwares but also about the events and summits that they have organized in Vietnam, Cambodia and Singapore, where the developers in Asia had a huge gathering and such events and summits will keep taking part in different parts of Asia in future. To find out more about FOSSASIA visit their home page, <a href="http://fossasia.org">http://fossasia.org</a>.

Its also important to have an understanding of what open source is. In simple words it means that the software/application that is told to be open source has it's source code open to all. Developers can take it and do their own modifications. For a better explanation on what open source is, check the article <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">here</a>.

Now before taking part in Google Code-in I also didn't have a clear idea on open source projects and wasn't really sure on how to become part of it, but as I am taking part by doing these tasks, I am getting a my on ideas on open source projects are getting clearer.

Every mentor organization has their own interesting projects, but FOSSASIA particularly took my interest for few reasons. The main reason is simply because I found FOSSASIA projects more suitable for myself. They have quite a few web design and development tasks, a field that I can confidently say I am skilled at. The second biggest reason is similar to first, that is FOSSASIA has a few open source android applications. I have recently gotten into Android Development, and believe that the applications brought by FOSSASIA community would be a good workspace to start on making my knowledge of android development more profound. After all, you should know how it works: you gotta code, code, code to be skilled.

Below there are some of the github repositories that have strongly taken my interest. Presently I haven't gone into details, but will hopefully look into it very soon. <br/>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/bodyapps-android">Bodyapps</a> - An android application that can do measurement of various body parts</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/susi_android">Susi</a> - A chat application that provides user support through implementing data science and machine learning concepts. </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/loklak_search">loklak search</a> - It is a Distributed Social Media Message Search Server, which collects searches, downloads, and visualizes messages from various social resources</li>
</ul>
Their repositories don't end with these, their community has worked and is still working on many other projects that are made available to all, more information can be found <a href="http://labs.fossasia.org/#projects">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/">here</a>.  

Till now I have mostly done projects were simply a practice for the skill that I have learnt. I only have a few projects that I could share with world with pride and say that
I have successfully made a something great for the society. Actually, I don't think I can say that for any of them. Making great softwares and application is fun and exciting, but it is not something that be done easily by one.  

Therefore, communities like FOSSASIA means a lot to people like me, who wants to do be able to contribute to our society with something big. It is common to have this misconception that doing something for the open source community doesn't really benefit one, but that really isn't true. By being able to contribute my work to a big community like FOSSASIA, it also means that I have successfully become a part of this big community, and this is something that one can definitely be proud of. Personally, now that I have seen all these open projects from FOSSASIA I feel more motivated to learn new skills so that I am able to contribute something larger next time. Not only motivated but it also has given me a purpose behind some of my work and has helped me think of my next steps into the developer world.

I plan to keep myself a part of open source community forever. In future I would love be get enough skilled to not only be have large contribution to FOSSASIA community, but also to many other open source communities. This is just the start of my journey on Open Source with FOSSASIA, there is still a long way to go.
