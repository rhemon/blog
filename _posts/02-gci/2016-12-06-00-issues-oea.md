<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/{{page.head_image}}" width="300px" height="520px" />
</div>

1. The Location Cards
2. The font size in session details
3. The TabLayout

The above three in the Open Event Android app weren't following material design and so I have done few small tweaks in the design to do that. Pull requests and issues will be found in their <a href="github.com/fossasia/open-event-android">repository</a>.
