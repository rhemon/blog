Sorry for delaying this post for a long time.After GCI ended and finalists and winners were 
announced I got busy with my studies and other stuff,so couldn't manage the time to write
up a post on my results.

In the end besides the reward of knowledge I gained throughout the
time period I participated in GCI with FOSSASIA, I managed to be a finalist in FOSSASIA.
Congrats to Yuki and Oana to be make into the top two, grand prize winner. 

Even after so many months, thinking back of that time makes me feel proud; I may not have
done any massive contribution but I do feel like I atleast got something done.

I feel very sorry that I am not being able to hold onto my promise of to keep on contributing
to the awesome projects of FOSSASIA. Even now, once in a while I do try to work
on some issues in coala. Generally either I am busy with my studies or indulged 
into the new interest I have grown in machine learning. Lately been doing some courses
related to that, so if not studying I am usually doing something related to ml (hopefully,
I will be writing a post on that and a project(nothing extraordinary :( ) I am doing with it).

Well thats that, once again I managed to be a finalist with the help of all the amazing mentors
and fellow participants in GCI. Thanks a lot to their help, that I managed to achieve something.
It was a great experience and had a great time. Its regrettable that was my first and last time
in GCI, but we shall meet again in Google GSoC.
