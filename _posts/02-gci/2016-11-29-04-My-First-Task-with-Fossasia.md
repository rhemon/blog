My first task was something really simple. First I had to create a Github account, and
fork and star some of the amazing repositories of <a href="github.com/fossasia">FOSSASIA</a>
I also had to write two paragraphs on how I use git, which I pretty much use in all of my project so it
was quite easy to write. Secondly I had to fill up a form to join the student github team, and within 24 hours one of the mentors sent invitation for the student team. Finally,  I simply had to tweet about me doing my first task with FOSSASIA.

With this simple task I have started my journey in Google Code-in.
