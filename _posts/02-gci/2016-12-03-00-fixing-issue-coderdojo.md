I have successfully fixed one of the translation error in the CoderDojo website.
The problem was the translated sentence was distributed in two parts and so when translated
the order for that translated language will not be same as English, so that was leading to
translation error.

Thanks a lot to <a href="https://github.com/niccokunzmann">Nicco Kunzmann</a> for his
continuous support and discussion on how to solve this.
