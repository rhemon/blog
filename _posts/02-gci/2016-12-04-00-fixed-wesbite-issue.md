The task was to fix an issue for the website. I chose an <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/gci16.fossasia.org/issues/151#event-881175826">issue</a>
 where I had to fix a bug in slider. The second image was not displaying. Once I have fixed it I had done my <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/gci16.fossasia.org/pull/161">PR</a> and got it merged.
