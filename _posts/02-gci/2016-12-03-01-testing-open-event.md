My FOSSASIA's GCI task was from project <a href="http://eventyay.com"/>http://eventyay.com
where I was told to get the the android and then to find and repot issues. So after successfully installing and running the app, I have found some issue with sharing and had some suggestion for improving UI. Click <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue">here</a> to check the issues I have added.
