While doing some excel work for my dad, I stumbled upon something that went by the name of 'sieve analysis of aggregates'. To do it in excel was quite simple, all I needed was to enter some data
and excel would do all the calculation and form a semi-log graph for me. The only repetitive task I had was finding the values of Y coordinate when X is 60 and 10.
After finding that I would have to type those data, and excel would find the final piece of data - uniform
coefficient.

I recently got a developer account on play store and I really wanted to put up there for the world to judge.
It was then that I decided, to bring this simple task to an android app, where the user should only need to
enter the data. The app will read the graph and find the values of Y when X is 60 and 10, that also
reduces human error.  

Through this project I got myself more experienced with data storage, creating custom view, managing
fragments.

The code is available <a href="http://github.com/rhemon/aggregatesieveanalysis"> here </a>. The app can
be downloaded from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.rhemon.aggregatesieveanalysis"> here</a>. You can also have a view the project on my <a href="http://rhemon.github.io/portfolio/">portfolio</a>.
